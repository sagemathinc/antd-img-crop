# antd-img-crop

This is a fork of [upstream](https://github.com/nanxiaobei/antd-img-crop)  because of [this issue](https://github.com/nanxiaobei/antd-img-crop/issues/214). I need common js support still, or at least for commonjs importing to not break. This is just like upstream, except the common js module is basically empty so it doesn't crash when run server side.

See [https://github.com/nanxiaobei/antd\-img\-crop](https://github.com/nanxiaobei/antd-img-crop) for docs.
